<h1>PunBB 1.0 Installation</h1>

<p>NOTE: If you are upgrading from 1.0 RC 2, skip to section 3.</p>

<h2>1. Requirements</h2>

<ul>
<li>A webserver (preferably <a href=
"http://www.apache.org/">Apache</a>)</li>

<li><a href="http://www.php.net/">PHP</a> 4.2.0 or later</li>

<li><a href="http://www.mysql.com/">MySQL</a> or <a href=
"http://www.postgresql.org/">PostgreSQL</a> (see details
below)</li>
</ul>

<p>MySQL: Version 3.23 or later is recommended. PunBB will probably
work with older versions though.</p>

<p>PostgreSQL: PunBB 1.0 has only been tested on version 7.3.3 of
PostgreSQL. It should work fine with any version greater than 7.0
though. If the installer complains about not being able to create
an index, open up install.php and search for "PostgreSQL &lt;7.3
note".</p>

<h2>2. Installation</h2>

<p>Copy/upload all files and directories and run install.php from
the forum root directory. Follow the instructions. If you get an
error when trying to upload avatar images, make sure that PHP has
write access to the directory where you store avatars (default is
img/avatars). Please report any problems you might encounter during
installation in the forums at <a href=
"http://forums.punbb.org/">http://forums.punbb.org/</a>.</p>

<h2>3. Upgrading from 1.0 RC 2</h2>

<p>Follow these instructions to update your current 1.0 RC 2
installation to 1.0 final. It is recommended that the forum be put
into maintenance mode (Admin/Options) during the update
procedure.</p>

<p>NOTE: Make a backup before proceeding! Use the tool mysqldump
for MySQL and pg_dump for PostgreSQL. Also backup any CSS and
template files that you have made changes to.</p>

<ol>
<li>Update all scripts and files to 1.0. This is easily done by
extracting the 1.0 archive into the same directory as your old
installation (overwriting any existing files).</li>

<li>Copy the script 10_rc2_to_10_update.php from the directory
"extra" to the forum root directory and run it once. A message will
appear when the update process has completed. Once the update
script has finished you should remove the script from the forum
root directory.</li>

<li>Update any custom made css files so that the identifier names
no longer contain the character underscore. I.e. make "pun_head"
into "punhead".</li>
</ol>

<p>You should now be running PunBB 1.0.</p>

<h2>3. Maximizing performance</h2>

<p>Here are some recommendations for maximizing the performance of
PunBB. The recommendations are not directly related to PunBB
performance. They are very general and results may vary.</p>

<ul>
<li>Run it in a UNIX-like operating system!</li>

<li>Use the Apache webserver and compile PHP as a static module for
Apache.</li>

<li>Use a PHP caching tool (UNIX only). I recommend <a href=
"http://www.php-accelerator.co.uk/">PHP Accelerator</a> by Nick
Lindridge.</li>

<li>Make sure that PHP has zlib support so you can enable gzip
output compression in Admin/Options. This greatly reduces the size
of the HTML output at the cost of a little CPU time. An alternative
is to use the Apache module mod_gzip. The two methods yield similar
results.</li>

<li>Visit the administration interface and disable any forum
features that are not used or you feel are unnecessary.</li>
</ul>

<p>Thank you for using PunBB.<br>
